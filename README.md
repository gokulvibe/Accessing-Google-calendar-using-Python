# Accessing-Google-calendar-using-Python
In this project, we use the Google calendar API to integrate google calendar with Python.


The Calendar.py file, prints out the upcoming 10 events from your calendar to the console.

The Calendar2.py file, adds the event that you want (with the details that you specify) to your google calendar.
